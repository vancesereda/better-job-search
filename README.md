This is a simple front end that utilizes the Indeed API in some of the ways the website underuses it:
  
  1. Removing the sponsored listings that aren't sorted by date when one searches by date.
  
  2. Sorting by Easy Apply: the API has an unused endpoint for this (I have personally had the most responses with Easy Apply
    because it doesn't go through an ATS).


In the future, webscraping Glassdoor will be added.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and the UI components are from Semantic-UI.
