This is a simple front end that utilizes the Indeed API in some of the ways the website underuses it:
  
  1. Removing the sponsored listings that aren't sorted by date when one searches by date.
  
  2. Sorting by Easy Apply: the API has an unused endpoint for this (I have personally had the best response with Easy Apply
    because it doesn't go through an ATS).


In the future, I wish to webscrape for jobs on Glassdoor since there's no public API.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and the UI components are from Semantic-UI.
